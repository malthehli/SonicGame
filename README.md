In this project your group will choose a game to design and implement using JavaScript and the Canvas 2D API. 
Your group will implement the mobile game with multiple levels, collision detection, audio effects and graphics and animation.
First your group will submit a Game Design Document as per specification and rubrics. After approval your group will start implementing the game. After development the game must be hosted on website so that it can be accessed easily from the mobile phone. The game also needs to be deployed as an Android or iOS app. Use itch.io, Firebase hosting or repl.it to host your game and share it the wider community.

What we did:
-The aim of our game is to provide entertainment and excitement to the players by being inspired by a real-life game called sonic the hedgehog, the game uses the concentration of the player to complete it, sonic the hedgehog is the mascot of the well-known company that is Sega.

-In this game sonic needs to bypass and avoid many obstacles that comes in various kinds for example some monsters, blocks, and most importantly timing being cut down each round as it is the main point and idea of out character sonic the hedgehog.

-The Time interval will be time limited as we said the focus of the game is to complete the level by avoiding the obstacles within the time limit, the player mode will be single player mode because it will be one character to play with and to complete the obstacles.

-The gameplay of the game will be to avoid the obstacles that come in your way and try to finish it as fast as possible and gain all points.
Each level will add more obstacles and points, then the last 2 levels you will introduce monsters to the game until the last level.
To progress to the other level, you will be required to gain all the points and don’t get eaten by the monsters.
